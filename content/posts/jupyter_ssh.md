## Jupyter Notebooks {#jupyter-notebooks}

[![](/img/misc/jupyter_logo.png)](/img/misc/jupyter_logo.png)
I love [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. As someone who primarily works on data science projects in Python, Jupyter is probably the most important tool in my toolchain. For the uninitiated, Jupyter notebooks are documents that can contain live code, visualizations, and descriptive text. By breaking code into chunks, Jupyter notebooks let you run your code in a non-linear way, jumping from block to block and letting Jupyter keep track of variables and environment. Rather than writing a python file and then running the whole thing, Jupyter lets you add in print() statements and visualization commands half-way through the execution of your code easy.

Youtuber Corey Schafer has an amazing breakdown, shown below:
