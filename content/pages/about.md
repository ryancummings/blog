## Welcome! {#welcome}

I'm Ryan and this is my website. I am a medical student specializing in radiology, hoping to one day shape the future of medicine through artificial intelligence. In the meantime, I have a lot to figure out and even more to write about, and started this blog to catch the overflow.

This blog is unique because it lives in a plain-text file on my computer. The file is nothing special at all really, just a ton of text and a few hyperlinks to images and colors. What turns the blog from a text file into what you see here is a neat program called [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo), which is itself an add-on to an even more incredible piece of software called [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). This infinitely-expandable text editor has held every note I took in medical school, every academic paper I've ever written, every todo-list and shopping-list, and basically everything else in my brain for almost 7 years now. Seriously, it's all in Emacs, and I couldn't live without it.

Over the course of this blog, I'll be writing technical guides relevant to Emacs, AI, web development, and anything else I have figured out and want to remember or share. I'll also be writing about medical training, philosophy, cycling, my dog, or any of my other million hobbies. With my goldfish memory, it pays for me to keep tabs on what I'm doing and what I'm thinking about, and this blog will be part of that process. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up scatter-brained, considering the source material.

So read an article and enjoy!
